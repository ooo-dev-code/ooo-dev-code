<b>Hi, I am ooo-dev-code. </b> 
I'm in highschool and I've started this github account to get a good job for my resume. I am a begginer developper who code principaly website and python progral to help me in my day.

For example, I have created, in python, <b>a github shortway using selenium and a bot to rewrite my readme everyday</b> ( both present in the pinned repository ) and <b>a TinyTask in tkinter</b> ( present in my repositories ) who's not very complex but useful for a game that my little brother is playiing ( yes, that's a cheat but it's fun ). Python is my favorite language and I know many things particularly in data science and web developpement.
I also train myself to do all the things that I can do in python in JavaScript so every project that I have made in python, I can make it in Js.

I'm actually learning React and Django.
