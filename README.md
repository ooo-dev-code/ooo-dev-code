<i><h2>I'm a high school student and I started this GitHub account to build a strong resume for future job opportunities.</h2></i>
I'm a beginner developer with a focus on web development and Python programming. I create projects to help me with everyday tasks and expand my skills. 
   
For example, I created a Python program using Selenium to create a <b>shortcut for GitHub</b> and a bot that rewrites my README every day (though Iâ€™ve currently deactivated it). I also built a simple game helper tool for my younger brother, called <b>TinyTask</b> in Tkinter (available in my repositories), which may be a cheat but it's fun!

In addition to these, Iâ€™ve worked on several full-stack projects such as a <b>School Management System</b> and my <b>Portfolio website</b>.

I also develop games in Java, such as a <b>Game Engine</b> and a <b>Space Invaders clone</b>.

Python is my favorite language, and Iâ€™m particularly interested in data science and web development. Currently, Iâ€™m diving into computer vision and machine learning.

<i><strong><u>Currently learning: GO and C++.</u></strong></i>
