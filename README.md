# <b>Hi, I am ooo-dev-code. </b> 

<i><h2 classname="Subtitle">I'm in highschool and I've started this github account to get a good job for my resume.</br>
I am a begginer developper who code principaly website and python programms to help me in my day.</h2></i>

For example, I have created, in python, <b>a github shortway using selenium and a bot to rewrite my readme everyday that I have desactivated</b> ( both present in the pinned repository ) and <b>a TinyTask in tkinter</b> ( present in my repositories ) who's not very complex but useful for a game that my little brother is playing ( yes, that's a cheat but it's fun ).

Python is my favorite language and I know many in this language things particularly in data science and web developpement.

I also train myself to do all the things that I can do in python in JavaScript so every project that I have made in python, I can make it in Js.

<i><strong>I'm actually learning React and Django.</strong></i></br>
