-> Hi I'm ooo-dev-code                                             
-> I'm have a big passion in quantum physics                          
-> I'm currently learning Blender and js                                    
-> I'm trying to be good enough in code to get a good job for my CV                                              
-> I'm in college and that's pretty easy                             
-> Fun fact/ I have made a code who write a new readme everyday so I can get 1 contribution per day at least                                 

I just started this github account and I started python since 2-3 months. I'm sorry if my codes aren't very good but I'm trying my best. One day I ill be a good coder.                                                    
-> My wish is to get an ingeneer level in codage in 2027 maximum.
